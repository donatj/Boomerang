Boomerang! is a simple Frisby.js inspired API E2E endpoint testing framework, providing the tools you need to validate REST responses.

Boomerang! consumes your API and validates your defined set of expectations, alerting you to any problems that arise.

Boomerang! is still in active development and more info is coming soon!

Documentation and more information is availible at http://boomerang.work/

## Requirements

- PHP 5.4.0+ with CLI and SPL
- *nix or cygwin on windows.

## Installation

Using composer, `boomerang` can be installed globally via: 

```bash
$ composer global require 'boomerang/boomerang'
```

Or if you are using composer for the project you wish to test, you can simply add it as a [vendor binary](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/vendor-binaries.md):

```json
{
  "require-dev": {
      "boomerang/boomerang": "~0.2.0"
  }
}
```

## Development

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/donatj/Boomerang.git Boomerang
$ cd Boomerang
$ composer.phar install
```

### Basic Execution

The easiest way to test is simply using the composer executable.

From the root of the cloned project, execute 
```bash
$ ./vendor/bin/boomerang
```

### Building a Phar

You will need Composer to fetch the requirements

```bash
$ php create-phar.php
```
